# To create a linear regression:
x=c(some values)
y=c(some other values)
relation=lm(y~x) enter
summary(relation)enter
where y is dependent variable and x is independent variable, so dependent variable comes first lm(y~x).


# For multi variables/ Multi Regression:

-Import excel file into R then give the file name . example:
Evapo=read.csv("C:\\Users\\suman markuna\\Desktop\\Dr.P.K.csv",header=T)
Evapo enter

-Then to check the structure:
str(Evapo)

-Then for Regression Analysis:
Reg=lm(E~Tmax+Tmin+Rh1+W,data=Evapo)
summary(Reg)

-If we wants to predict dependent variable by using some data of independent variable for future reference . example:
predict(Reg,data.frame("Tmax"=50,"Tmin"=20,"Rh1"=96,"W"=5))
str(Evapo)
where; Tmax,Tmin,Rh1,w are independent and E is dependent variable. And Evapo is a file name in the above example.s

-If we forget the no of variables in the file because of large data then we can use to remember the variables as in short forms:
head(filename)  example:
head(Evapo)

-If we wants to plot observed data from the data which is given as a dependent variable such as:
Eo=Evapo$E
plot(Eo)
where Eo= observed evaporation data as the data given by sir.
Ep=predict(Reg,data=Evapo)
head(Ep)

-To plot the data between observed and predicted values:
plot(Eo,Ep)
where Ep= Predicted evaporation

-To find correaltion between Eo and Ep:
cor(Eo,Ep)


#For correlation:
cor(E,Tmax,Tmin,Rh1,W)
cor(Evapo)
pairs(Evapo)
